                The full stack developer definition is “someone who can work on both the back-end and front-end of systems.
                ” This means that they can develop fully fledged platforms (with databases, servers and clients) 
                which don’t need other applications to function.  
                The Full Stack Engineer job description includes using a range of different technologies and languages (such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, C#) to develop applications. 
                Full Stack Developers approach software holistically since they cater to both user experience and functionality.
